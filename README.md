# Autofix
---

Autofix, a background script to automatically execute `autorun.inf` files on drives, like Windows used to do.
**Please note: this project is unmaintained! I have plans to rewrite this for efficiency, but it won't happen anytime soon.**

## Installation
---

Download the prebuilt `Autofix x64.zip` from the releases page and extract it.
Otherwise, run via Python:
```
git clone https://github.com/iiPythonx/Autofix
cd Autofix
python3 -m pip install -r deps.txt
```

## Running
---
To start Autofix, run the exe file (in `Autofix x64`), otherwise, run the .pyw file.
It is recommended that you add it as a startup program.
