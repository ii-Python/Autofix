# Autofix
---

Autofix, a background script to automatically execute `autorun.inf` files on drives, like Windows used to do.


## Installation
---

Download the prebuilt `Autofix.exe` from the releases page.
Otherwise, run via Python:
```
git clone https://github.com/ii-Python/Autofix
cd Autofix
python3 -m pip install -r deps.txt
```

## Running
---
To start Autofix, run the exe file (if you downloaded it), otherwise, run the .pyw file.
It is recommended that you add it as a startup program.
