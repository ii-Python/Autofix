# Autofix
---

Autofix, a background script to automatically execute `autorun.inf` files on drives, like Windows used to do.


## Installation
---
```
git clone https://github.com/ii-Python/Autofix
cd Autofix
cp daemon.py daemon.pyw
python3 -m pip install -r deps.txt
```

To start the process, simply run the pyw file. It is recommended that you add it as a startup program.
